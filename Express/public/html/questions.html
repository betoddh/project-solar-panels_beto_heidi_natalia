            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions about Solar Panels</h1>
                    <div  class="box">
                    <h2>How do solar panels work?</h2>
                    <h3>Solar panels are made up of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity. These cells generate direct current (DC), which is sent to an inverter to convert it into alternating current (AC), the type of electricity used by household appliances.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div  class="box">
                    <h2>How much money can I save with solar panels?</h2>
                    <h3>The amount of money you can save depends on factors like the amount of sunlight your location receives, the cost of electricity in your area, and the size of your solar system. On average, solar panels can significantly reduce your electricity bill, with some households saving between 50% and 100% on their energy costs.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                    <h2>How long do solar panels last?</h2>
                    <h3>Solar panels typically last between 25 and 30 years. While their energy production gradually decreases over time, most panels still operate at around 80% of their original capacity after 25 years.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                    <h2>What happens on cloudy days?</h2>
                    <h3>Solar panels can still generate electricity on cloudy days, though their output will be reduced compared to sunny days. The exact amount depends on cloud density, but on average, you can expect them to produce between 10% and 25% of their maximum capacity in cloudy conditions.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                    <h2>Is my home suitable for solar panels?</h2>
                    <h3>For a home to be suitable for solar panels, the roof should ideally receive direct sunlight for most of the day, face south (in the northern hemisphere) or north (in the southern hemisphere), and not be shaded by trees or buildings. It's also important that the roof is in good structural condition.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                    <h2>Do solar panels require maintenance?</h2>
                    <h3>Solar panels require very little maintenance. It's recommended to clean them periodically to ensure they are not covered by dust, leaves, or other debris that could block sunlight. Additionally, inverters and other components should be checked by a professional every few years.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                    <h2>What is the initial investment for installing solar panels?</h2>
                    <h3>The cost of installing residential solar panels (3 kW to 5 kW) ranges between MXN 45,000 and MXN 100,000 (USD 2,500 to USD 5,500). Incentives like tax deductions and zero-interest loans can reduce this investment, which is typically recovered through electricity savings within 4 to 7 years.</h3>
